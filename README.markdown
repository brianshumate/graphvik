GraphVik
========

One of my favorite artists is [Vik Muniz](http://www.vikmuniz.net/). He's an amazingly grounded, humble, and truly engaged human being that has found a way to harness the power of art for immediate benefits to his hometown communities and beyond.

He knows his roots and has given back immensely, while conveying brilliance and thought in his art that is both fresh and very exciting to me.

If you have not become familiar with his work, I encourage you to check out the following resources about him:

* [Vik Muniz](http://www.vikmuniz.net/) Website
* [Vik Muniz Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vik_Muniz)
* [Wasteland](http://www.wastelandmovie.com/) is an amazing documentary; you'll instantly understand what I have said about him above.

As a tribute to him and his work, and in acknowledgement of his particular style of art via assemblage, I put together this initial project that I call ***GraphVik***, which is a force directed graph visualization of Vik based on 1500 SVG rendered tiles derived from a photo of him.

I'm using [d3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) + [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and I sliced the tiles with code that is not part of the project. The tiles are also omitted because their number slows things down. I may make the tiles available later, but would want to make sure this is something that is okay to do legally (I would imagine it is since I consider this code and its output to be an artwork of mine).

This is the kind of stuff I enjoy whipping up on a Sunday morning whim over coffee.
